# Framed Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## v0.8.14-alpha

- **12.0.5 compatibility** — fix `bad argument #2 to '?' (Current Field: [isContainer])` error on unit frame spawn; 12.0.5 added a required `isContainer` field to `C_UnitAuras.AddPrivateAuraAnchor`'s args table
- Add `/framed aurastate [unit]` debug slash — dumps the classified aura flag breakdown for a unit (defaults to target), showing which of `external-defensive`, `important`, `player-cast`, `big-defensive`, `raid`, `boss`, `from-player-or-pet` apply to each aura. Useful for verifying classification correctness as #115's B-series migrations land
- Internal: AuraState now exposes shared per-frame classification (`GetHelpfulClassified` / `GetHarmfulClassified` / `GetClassifiedByInstanceID`) with write-path invalidation wired through `FullRefresh` and `ApplyUpdateInfo`. No element yet consumes the new API — infrastructure only in this patch, element migrations follow in subsequent releases (#115 B1-B6)

## v0.8.13-alpha

- **12.0.5 readiness** — fix Buffs `castBy = 'me'` / `'others'` silently filtering to empty when Blizzard marks `sourceUnit` secret in combat (#113); the indicator now falls back to `isFromPlayerOrPlayerPet` when the source is unreachable
- Guard `UnitIsUnit` call sites against compound-token nil returns so 12.0.5's stricter token handling doesn't error (#122)
- Invalidate the aura cache on encounter boundaries so boss-aura changes don't stick across pulls (#123)
- Halve `IconTicker` per-frame cost and skip redundant threshold setters on aura icons (#114)
- Fix `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` on `FramedPinnedAnchor:Hide` when a roster update arrives mid-combat — Pinned `Refresh()` now defers to `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` if combat is locked down (mirrors the existing `pendingResolve` pattern)
- Buffs aura filter is now derived from the indicator set instead of a separate `buffFilterMode` config key — any indicator with a spell list widens the query to `HELPFUL` so specific tracked spells (e.g. follower Rejuvenation) can surface; otherwise stays on `HELPFUL|RAID_IN_COMBAT` to keep trivial raid buffs out. The vestigial `buffFilterMode` key (never had UI) is dropped and migrated out of existing saves

## v0.8.12-alpha

- **Pinned Frames in Edit Mode** — the drag catcher and selected preview now render the full 9-slot grid instead of a single fake frame, so moving pinned frames in edit mode reflects what you'll actually see in-game
- Pinned anchor convention flipped to TOPLEFT to match boss/arena (drag math, catcher bounds, and live layout now agree); existing CENTER-anchored pinned saves are auto-migrated on load to the equivalent TOPLEFT offset so nothing visually shifts
- Pinned geometry edits (width, height, columns, spacing) live-update without the grid flashing during resize, and Resize Anchor compensation keeps the pivot edge visually fixed instead of bouncing back on each slider tick
- Pinned placeholder identity labels ("Pin 1" … "Pin 9") and slot name tags ("Click to assign", character name) now scale with `Name font size` (primary and primary−2, floor 8) — previously hardcoded text looked oversized at non-1.0 UI scales
- Fix edit-mode first drag doing nothing visible — clicking-and-dragging immediately (without releasing first) now selects the frame so the preview appears as you drag
- Fix group position sliders (party, raid, arena, boss) not moving the real frame during slider drag in edit mode — the handler only supported solo CENTER anchoring
- Fix edit-mode preview not rebuilding when position/size sliders change — preview now tracks slider motion in real time via the EditCache
- Fix inline edit panel sliders and dropdowns sometimes missing clicks — split into a sibling shield + panel so children hit-test uncontested; inline panel rebuilds on preset switch so sliders read the active preset's config
- Fix boss and arena frames saving off-screen after a drag — they were written as TOPLEFT offsets but reapplied as CENTER offsets on reload/preset change. Now TOPLEFT end-to-end via a `PSEUDO_GROUPS` cascade path; existing saves self-heal because the stored values were already in TOPLEFT space
- Narrow pinned settings card keeps a 2-column quick-nav summary (was collapsing to 1 column and pushing most rows below the fold); summary rows reflow mid-animation so labels no longer clip past the card edge while the card width tweens
- Preset switches now redirect away from preset-specific panels (e.g. pinned under Solo) even while Settings is hidden, so reopening doesn't flash a stale panel
- Inline edit panel stripped down to just Position & Layout — edit mode is strictly for positioning; all other settings live in the main Settings window with live previews
- Internal cleanup: drop inert `config.count` from pinned (always capped at 9, no UI), consolidate pinned frame-scale handling onto a single anchor-level `RegisterForUIScale` (removes the per-frame gear counter-scale workaround), and rename a shadowed migration local to keep luacheck clean

## v0.8.11-alpha

- **Pinned Frames** — up to 9 standalone frames that track specific group members by name, following players across roster reshuffles. Supports Focus / Focus Target / name-target slots. Role-grouped class-colored assignment dropdown available from the Settings card, empty-slot placeholder click, and a hover-gear icon on assigned pins (out of combat). First-class aura configuration across all 10 aura sub-panels. Per-preset; absent in Solo
- Pinned Frames Settings panel with master enable toggle in the preview card, inline slot assignment, and live-update routing so edits apply without `/reload`
- EditMode integration for Pinned Frames — drag to position (CENTER anchor convention matches the settings panel), click in edit mode to open the inline Pinned panel, hide from the sidebar when the active preset has no `pinnedConfig`
- Empty-slot placeholders render a dimmed identity label (Pin 1 … Pin 9) and become clickable targets for assignment; placeholder mouse-handling is gated so hidden gear icons don't swallow clicks
- **FramePreview** now renders the pinned grid alongside the other unit types, and uses `statusText.position` consistently instead of stale anchor keys that caused name tags to drift in the preview
- Bridge `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` through `EventBus` so combat-flush listeners can register via `F.EventBus:Register` instead of maintaining their own event frames
- Fix pinned gear icon rendering larger on resolved frames than on unresolved (placeholder) frames at non-1.0 UIParent scales — live-frame gears now counter-scale to match the placeholder gear's physical size
- Fix `attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'x' (a nil value)` crash in `FrameConfigText.lua` when toggling Health → Attach to name off. The Health element wasn't recording detached anchor values at setup when the text was created attached, so the live toggle had no coordinates to restore to
- Internal cleanup: drop Cell references from in-code comments (licensing hygiene — Cell is ARR), remove the defensive `SettingsCards.Pinned` existence guard for idiom consistency, collapse empty stub branches in the pinned gear-icon path

## v0.8.10-alpha

- Add **Frame Preview Card** — every Frame settings panel (player/target/party/raid/boss/arena/pet/solo) now renders a live unit frame preview at the top of the panel using your current config, pinned next to a summary card that stays in view while the settings scroll
- Raid preview card includes a 1–40 count stepper saved per character, so you can dial the preview to the group size you're actually tuning for
- Party preview includes a pet toggle to preview pet frames alongside party members
- **Focus Mode** — click a settings card (Health Color, Castbar, Auras, etc.) to spotlight the matching element in the preview; other elements dim to 20%. Your selection persists across `/reload`
- Preview card and frames animate smoothly when you change count, toggle Focus Mode, or resize the settings window
- Preview re-renders live as you edit config — structural changes (count, spacing) rebuild, cosmetic changes (colors, textures) just refresh
- Migrate **Defensives** and **Externals** panels to the same pinned Preview | Overview layout for consistency with the Frame panels
- Fix boss and arena previews where per-frame castbars overlapped the next frame instead of sitting cleanly below
- Fix boss/party/arena preview card titles truncating — fixed-count unit cards now get enough width for the title and Focus Mode toggle; raid keeps its auto-sizing
- Scrollbar UX: hover the right-edge strip to reveal the scrollbar (no more stolen clicks from mouse-motion detection), and dragging the thumb keeps it visible and fires lazy-load
- **Buffs/Debuffs** panels: auto-select the first enabled indicator on open; add/delete indicators with a cleaner inline form (Plus/Tick icons)
- **SpellList**: fix spell ID and name truncation, combine hover tooltip, tighten the ID column
- **StatusText**: replace the dead anchor controls with a proper position switch
- **Copy To**: move the control into the sub-header with a dropdown + direct-write button (the old standalone dialog is gone)
- Fix party pet ghost frames when members joined the group; roster now refreshes properly
- Guard party pet cross-zone check against secret values so it doesn't error in combat
- Fix `RoleIcon` not refreshing on spec change, and fix style 2 to use the correct quadrant overrides
- Revert a `PartyMemberFrame` state-visibility driver change that was breaking Blizzard's own frame cleanup
- Fix `StyleBuilder` preset `groupKey` fallback accidentally applying to derived presets — now scoped to base presets only
- Update summon-pending status text and color
- Add third-party library attribution to the README and mirror it in the About card
- Internal cleanup: drop dead code (`Core/DispelCapability.lua`, `Core/Version.Compare`, `CopyToDialog`), luacheck branch is clean

## v0.8.9-alpha

- Fix party/raid role sorting being silently ignored — the header was writing a nameList but kept `sortMethod='INDEX'`, which falls through Blizzard's sort branches and leaves frames in default order; now uses `sortMethod='NAMELIST'` so role order actually takes effect
- Fix `attempt to compare a secret number value` error from the cast tracker's recheck-skip optimization — the spellId comparison now guards against secret values returned by `UnitCastingInfo`/`UnitChannelInfo` in combat
- Fix `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` on `FramedPartyPet1:ClearAllPoints()` when party composition changed mid-combat — pet re-anchor is now deferred until `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` when the secure frames are locked down
- Internal cleanup: drop hardcoded fallback values in the Dispellable element that duplicated canonical defaults from `Presets/Defaults.lua`

## v0.8.8-alpha

- The new **Backups** system is now feature-complete — save, rename, load, and delete named snapshots, with inline export/import, version and size metadata, stale-version warnings, last-loaded tracking, and roundtrip verification that reports exactly which keys differ from your current config
- Fix Backups snapshot rows overflowing at narrow widths — titles now wrap above the buttons, the metadata line (version · date · layouts · size) wraps below the version when it's too long, and the row grows to fit; very narrow widths stack the buttons under the text
- Fix buttons disappearing from a Backups row when its Export area was opened — buttons are now pinned to the top of the row and the export area expands downward from the row's current height
- Fix auto-backup rows having an empty slot where Rename would be — Export now sits directly next to Delete
- Fix Rename edit box not dismissing when clicking the Rename button again or clicking outside the field; pressing Escape or Enter also closes it cleanly
- Style the version and author name in the About card with the accent color
- Polish inline dropdowns (underline, chevron, accent default) and cascade EditBox width through anchors so nested inputs size correctly
- Fix a race in the Toast dismiss animation that could leave a stale frame visible when a new toast slid in on top of it
- Show the active preset name in accent color in the Settings header

## v0.8.6-alpha

- Fix import/export failing with "Invalid payload structure" on every valid import — a double-pcall was silently dropping the deserialized payload; also rewrite the error messages in plain language
- Add tooltips on the Import mode switch explaining what Replace and Merge actually do
- Fix **Missing Buffs** indicator running even when disabled in settings
- Fix party/raid role sorting occasionally snapping frames to the wrong position on first group spawn — roster events are now bridged through EventBus and the nameList is rebuilt once group membership is fully populated
- Backfill aura sub-table defaults into existing saved presets — Arena/Boss/Solo/Minimal frames no longer end up missing dispellable, defensive, external, and missing-buff configuration after upgrading
- Guard **Private Auras** and **Targeted Spells** against partial config tables so missing optional sub-tables no longer error during Setup
- Reduce cast-tracker broadcast chatter by skipping redundant updates
- Polish **Framed Overview** illustrations and dim the background while the Overview is open
- Retarget the Setup Wizard card's Tour button to the new Overview (old `Onboarding/Tour.lua` removed in v0.8.5-alpha)
- Internal cleanup: drop unused imports, rename shadowing locals, fix luacheck warnings across Elements, Settings, Widgets, and builders

## v0.8.5-alpha

- Add **Framed Overview** — a 6-page illustrated walkthrough covering layouts, edit mode, settings cards, aura indicators, and defensives/externals; auto-shows on first login after the setup wizard and can be relaunched from Appearance → Setup Wizard → Take Overview
- Escape collapses the Overview to a top-right pip instead of leaking to the game menu; click the pip to resume
- Replace the unreachable guided tour with the new Overview (old `Onboarding/Tour.lua` removed)
- Promote `SetupAccentHover` to the shared Widgets library so other panels can reuse the accent fade
- Export `F.Preview.ApplyUnitToFrame` so the Overview welcome page can render a live 3-member party sample
- Add role sorting for raid and party frames (Tank/Healer/DPS ordering via SecureGroupHeader nameList)
- Raid role mode: flat sort across groups, follows orientation and anchor point
- Party role mode: single sorted column
- Add Sorting settings card with role order presets
- Add icon-row dropdown widget showing inline role icon previews
- Edit mode preview and click catcher now reflect sort mode layout
- Fix edit mode preset switch snapping frames to top-left when target preset had no config for that frame
- Post release notes to Discord from the release workflow

## v0.8.4-alpha

- Fix stale target/focus frame auras after retarget — aura cache now invalidates on token reassignment events (PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED, PLAYER_FOCUS_CHANGED, UNIT_TARGET, group/arena/boss/nameplate updates) instead of only UNIT_AURA
